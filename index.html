            <p>Hi, Im Faiza, a UX/UI designer passionate about crafting engaging and enjoyable experiences. I get a thrill out of creating user-centred solutions that are not only visually appealing, but also super functional and intuitive.</p>
                <p>My background in psychology has brought a unique perspective to my UX design work. Understanding how people think, feel, and behave has helped me create user-centred designs that are intuitive and easy to use. I believe that the best UX design is not just aesthetically pleasing, but also empathetic and inclusive.</p>
                <p>When I'm not designing, you can find me behind the lens of my camera or exploring new places around the world. Photography and travelling inspire me to see the world in new ways and bring fresh perspectives to my design work.</p>
                <p>I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and create meaningful experiences for users. Feel free to reach out and say hello!</p>
